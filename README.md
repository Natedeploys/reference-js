What is it?

Reference-js is a collection of helpers for Node that allow you to import, export and convert between BibTex, EndNote, XML, JSON files and more.

How does it work?

Formats from Reference managers can be converted into JSON and back. Using this approach, you are able to leverage the library to convert between other formats e.g. Bibtex to JSON to RIS behind the scenes.

We recommend storing your references in JSON format as it is highly compatible with NoSQL databases and Web Applications.

In Progress:

[ ] - Bibtex to JSON
[ ] - JSON to Bibtex

Future:

[ ] - XML to JSON
[ ] - JSON to XML
[ ] - RIS to JSON
[ ] - JSON to RIS
