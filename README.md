## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Reference-js is a collection of helpers for Node that allow you to import, export and convert between BibTex, EndNote, XML, JSON files and more.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will set reference-js up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to use the API.

### Prerequisites

You will need NodeJS and NPM. Not sure if you have node or npm? use in your terminal:

```
node -v
```

or

```
node hello.js
```

### Installing

Install the package with

```
npm install @devisle/reference-js
```

Require in Node as

```js
const { BibTexToJSON } = require("@devisle/reference-js");
```

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Each function is tested agaisnt before release.

### Contributors

Run the tests using:

```
npm run test
```

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Formats from Reference managers can be converted into JSON and back. Using this approach, you are able to leverage the library to convert between other formats e.g. Bibtex to JSON to RIS behind the scenes.

## 🚀 Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

We recommend storing your references in JSON format as it is highly compatible with NoSQL databases and Web Applications.
